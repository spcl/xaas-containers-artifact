  "raw_response": "The build file you shared appears to be written in CMake, a popular build system for various programming languages. Based on the content of the file, I have identified several specialization points:\n\n1. **GPU Build**: The `gpu_build` section specifies whether the build should include GPU support and which build flag should be used.\n2. **GPU Backends**: The `gpu_backends` section lists available GPU backends (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL) along with their minimum version requirements and default usage settings.\n3. **Parallel Programming Libraries**: The `parallel_programming_libraries` section specifies parallel programming libraries to use (e.g., OpenMP, MPI) along with their minimum version requirements and default usage settings.\n4. **Linear Algebra Libraries**: The `linear_algebra_libraries` section specifies linear algebra libraries to use (e.g., BLAS, LAPACK) along with their minimum version requirements and conditions for usage.\n5. **FFT Libraries**: The `FFT_libraries` section specifies FFT libraries to use (e.g., FFmpeg, FFTW) along with their built-in status, default usage settings, and dependencies.\n6. **Other External Libraries**: The `other_external_libraries` section specifies other external libraries to link against (e.g., zlib, libpng) along with their versions, usage conditions, and build flags.\n7. **Compiler Flags**: The `compiler_flags` section lists compiler flags to use for the build process.\n8. **Optimization Build Flags**: The `optimization_build_flags` section specifies optimization-related build flags to use (e.g., `-O2`, `-fprefetch-loops`).\n9. **Compilers**: The `compilers` section specifies available compilers to use along with their minimum version requirements.\n10. **Architectures**: The `architectures` section lists supported architectures for the build process.\n11. **SIMD Vectorization**: The `simd_vectorization` section specifies SIMD vectorization settings, including the build flag and default usage status.\n12. **Build System**: The `build_system` section specifies the type of build system to use (CMake, Make) along with its minimum version requirement.\n13. **Internal Build**: The `internal_build` section specifies internal build-related settings, such as library names and build flags.\n\nThese specialization points allow you to customize the build process for your project by specifying various libraries, compilers, and build flags."
