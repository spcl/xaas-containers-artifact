Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU-aware MPI was not detected, will not use direct GPU communication. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you are certain about GPU-aware support in your MPI library, you can force its use by setting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

On host ault24.cscs.ch 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI processes
Using 16 OpenMP threads per MPI process

100 steps,      0.2 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 2.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 31%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.8%.


NOTE: 17 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options

GROMACS reminds you: "For the first time we can now mechanically simulate the cognitive process. We can make studies in artificial intelligence. Beyond that, this mechanism can be used to assist humans in learning. As we are going to have more mature students in greater numbers as time goes on, this type of teaching will probably be increasingly important." (Sister Mary Kenneth Keller)
