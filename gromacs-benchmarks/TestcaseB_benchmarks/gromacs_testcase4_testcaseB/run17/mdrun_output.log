Reading file /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 134
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host ault23.cscs.ch 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 16 OpenMP threads per MPI process

100 steps,      0.2 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 2.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 51%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.4%.


NOTE: 6 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      12 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 13 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
