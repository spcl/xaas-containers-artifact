Working dir:  /users/ealnuaim
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseA/ion_channel.tpr -ntomp 16 -gpu_id 0 -nsteps 100

Reading file /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseA/ion_channel.tpr, VERSION 2020.3 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 134
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.25 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.169


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host ault23.cscs.ch 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 16 OpenMP threads per MPI process


NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun 'Protein'
100 steps,      0.2 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was locked at the end of the run due to unfinished PP-PME balancing.
 Average load imbalance: 0.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 53%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.

GROMACS reminds you: "I went to Venice and looked at the paintings of Canaletto to understand how he presented perspective, and it turned out it was an exponential law. If I had published this, maybe there would be a Karplus law in art theory as well as the Karplus equation in NMR" (Martin Karplus, Nobel lecture 2013)
