                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2025.0 (-:

Executable:   /build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /scratch/run24
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /input_dir/lignocellulose.tpr -ntomp 36 -ntmpi 1 -nsteps 200

Compiled SIMD is AVX2_128, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).
Reading file /input_dir/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 200 steps, 0.4 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 36 OpenMP threads 


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun ''
200 steps,      0.4 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 31 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

GROMACS reminds you: "A weed scientist goes into a shop. He asks: 'Hey, you got any of that inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate-carboxyvinyl transferase?' Shopkeeper: 'You mean Roundup?' Scientist: 'Yeah, that's it. I can never remember that dang name!'" (John Pickett)
