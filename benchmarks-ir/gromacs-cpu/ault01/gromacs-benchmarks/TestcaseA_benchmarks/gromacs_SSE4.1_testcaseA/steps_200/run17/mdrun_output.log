                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2025.0 (-:

Executable:   /build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /scratch/run17
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr -ntomp 1 -ntmpi 1 -nsteps 200

Compiled SIMD is SSE4.1, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).
Reading file /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr, VERSION 2020.3 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 200 steps, 0.5 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1 to 1.093


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GROMACS reminds you: "For the first time we can now mechanically simulate the cognitive process. We can make studies in artificial intelligence. Beyond that, this mechanism can be used to assist humans in learning. As we are going to have more mature students in greater numbers as time goes on, this type of teaching will probably be increasingly important." (Sister Mary Kenneth Keller)
