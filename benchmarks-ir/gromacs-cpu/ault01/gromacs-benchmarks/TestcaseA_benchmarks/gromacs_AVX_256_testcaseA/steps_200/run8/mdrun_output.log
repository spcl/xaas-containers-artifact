                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2025.0 (-:

Executable:   /build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /scratch/run8
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr -ntomp 1 -ntmpi 1 -nsteps 200

Compiled SIMD is AVX_256, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).
Reading file /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr, VERSION 2020.3 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 200 steps, 0.5 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1 to 1.093


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints
