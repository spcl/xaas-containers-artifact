Executable:   /build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  / (source tree)
Working dir:  /scratch/run19
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr -ntomp 128 -ntmpi 1 -nsteps 20000 -resethway

Reading file /input_dir/ion_channel.tpr, VERSION 2020.3 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 20000 steps, 50 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.169


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 128 OpenMP threads 


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein'
20000 steps,     50.0 ps.

step 10000: resetting all time and cycle counters

Writing final coordinates.
