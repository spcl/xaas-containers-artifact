                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2025.0 (-:

Executable:   /build/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  / (source tree)
Working dir:  /scratch/run32
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /input_dir/lignocellulose.tpr -ntomp 64 -ntmpi 1 -nsteps 1000

Reading file /input_dir/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000 steps, 2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 64 OpenMP threads 


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun ''
1000 steps,      2.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 20 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
