PE 0: MPICH Warning: MPICH_NO_LOCAL is set to 1. 
      This setting disables all intra-node MPI optimizations.
      In addition, on systems with multiple NICs per node, this setting 
      forces HPE Cray MPI to only use a single NIC on each node. This 
      setting is intended only for debugging and may significantly 
      impact MPI performance.
