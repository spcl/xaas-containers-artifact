Compiled SIMD is None, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


WARNING: Using the slow plain-C-4x4 kernels. This should
not happen during routine usage on common platforms.

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

GROMACS reminds you: "The physical chemists never use their eyes and are most lamentably lacking in chemical culture. It is essential to cast out from our midst, root and branch, this physical element and return to our laboratories." (Henry Edward Armstrong)
