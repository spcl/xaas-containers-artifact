Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
