Compiled SIMD is None, but ARM_SVE might be faster (see log).

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


WARNING: Using the slow plain-C-4x4 kernels. This should
not happen during routine usage on common platforms.

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

GROMACS reminds you: "Should we force science down the throats of those that have no taste for it? Is it our duty to drag them kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century? I am afraid that it is." (George Porter)
