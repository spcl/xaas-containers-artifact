Reading file /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 300 steps, 0.6 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 300, rlist from 1.262 to 2.416


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 4 MPI threads
Using 64 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Note: Your choice of number of MPI ranks and amount of resources results in using 64 OpenMP threads per rank, which is most likely inefficient. The optimum is usually between 1 and 8 threads per rank.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 14.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 80%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 11.2%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %

NOTE: 11.2 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

GROMACS reminds you: "I identified myself very early on as a scientist rather than a student - as someone creating knowledge rather than simply absorbing it." (Emmanuelle Charpentier)
