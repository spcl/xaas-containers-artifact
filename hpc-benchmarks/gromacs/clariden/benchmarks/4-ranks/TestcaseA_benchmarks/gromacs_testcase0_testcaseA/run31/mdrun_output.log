Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 300 steps, 0.75 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 300, rlist from 1 to 1.81


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 4 MPI threads
Using 64 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Note: Your choice of number of MPI ranks and amount of resources results in using 64 OpenMP threads per rank, which is most likely inefficient. The optimum is usually between 1 and 8 threads per rank.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 18.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 36%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 6.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Z 0 %

NOTE: 6.7 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
