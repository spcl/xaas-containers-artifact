Reading file /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 134
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 300 steps, 0.6 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 300, rlist from 1.262 to 2.416


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

On host nid006900 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI processes
Using 64 OpenMP threads per MPI process

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 5.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 68%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.6%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
