Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

GROMACS reminds you: "For the first time we can now mechanically simulate the cognitive process. We can make studies in artificial intelligence. Beyond that, this mechanism can be used to assist humans in learning. As we are going to have more mature students in greater numbers as time goes on, this type of teaching will probably be increasingly important." (Sister Mary Kenneth Keller)
