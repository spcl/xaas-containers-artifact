GPU-aware MPI detected, but by default GROMACS will not make use the direct GPU communication capabilities of MPI. For improved performance try enabling the feature by setting the GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM environment variable.

Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 20000 steps, 50 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.169


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 104 OpenMP threads

GROMACS reminds you: "A weed scientist goes into a shop. He asks: 'Hey, you got any of that inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate-carboxyvinyl transferase?' Shopkeeper: 'You mean Roundup?' Scientist: 'Yeah, that's it. I can never remember that dang name!'" (John Pickett)
