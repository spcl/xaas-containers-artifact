Reading file /home/alokvk2/xaas-containers/data/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 104 OpenMP threads

100 steps,      0.2 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 11 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
