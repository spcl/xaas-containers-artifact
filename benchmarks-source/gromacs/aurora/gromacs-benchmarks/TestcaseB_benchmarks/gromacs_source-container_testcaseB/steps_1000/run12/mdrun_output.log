Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000 steps, 2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

NOTE: 19 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
