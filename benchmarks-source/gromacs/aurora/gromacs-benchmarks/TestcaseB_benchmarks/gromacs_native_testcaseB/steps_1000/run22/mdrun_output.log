Reading file /home/alokvk2/xaas-containers-artifact/data/gromacs/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 134
GPU-aware MPI detected, but by default GROMACS will not make use the direct GPU communication capabilities of MPI. For improved performance try enabling the feature by setting the GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM environment variable.

Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000 steps, 2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 104 OpenMP threads 

starting mdrun ''
1000 steps,      2.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up confout.gro to ./#confout.gro.6#

NOTE: 14 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
