Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#
Compiled SIMD is ARM_NEON_ASIMD, but ARM_SVE might be faster (see log).
Reading file /iopsstor/scratch/cscs/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 300 steps, 0.6 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 300, rlist from 1.262 to 2.416


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

This run has forced use of 'GPU-aware MPI'. However, GROMACS cannot determine if underlying MPI is GPU-aware. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you observe failures at runtime, try unsetting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process
Using 64 OpenMP threads
