Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /iopsstor/scratch/cscs/ealnuaim/gromacs_benchmarks/TestcaseB_benchmarks/gromacs_testcase2_testcaseB/run_33
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s /iopsstor/scratch/cscs/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr -ntomp 64 -bonded gpu -nb gpu -pin on -v -noconfout -dlb yes -nstlist 300 -gpu_id 0 -nsteps 300

Compiled SIMD is ARM_NEON_ASIMD, but ARM_SVE might be faster (see log).

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU-aware MPI was not detected, will not use direct GPU communication. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you are certain about GPU-aware support in your MPI library, you can force its use by setting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process
