Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU-aware MPI was not detected, will not use direct GPU communication. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you are certain about GPU-aware support in your MPI library, you can force its use by setting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process
Using 64 OpenMP threads

GROMACS reminds you: "You see it through a charmed medium: you can not discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scale bark." (Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte)
