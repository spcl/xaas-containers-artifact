Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000 steps, 2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

GPU-aware MPI was not detected, will not use direct GPU communication. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you are certain about GPU-aware support in your MPI library, you can force its use by setting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 64 OpenMP threads

1000 steps,      2.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 50 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
