Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 134
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 1000 steps, 2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 1 GPU task in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
Using 1 MPI process
Using 64 OpenMP threads

1000 steps,      2.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 18 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
