Compiled SIMD is ARM_NEON_ASIMD, but ARM_SVE might be faster (see log).

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

This run has forced use of 'GPU-aware MPI'. However, GROMACS cannot determine if underlying MPI is GPU-aware. Check the GROMACS install guide for recommendations for GPU-aware support. If you observe failures at runtime, try unsetting the GMX_FORCE_GPU_AWARE_MPI environment variable.

On host nid006644 1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:0,PP:0,PP:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
GPU direct communication will be used between MPI ranks.
Using 4 MPI processes
Using 64 OpenMP threads per MPI process

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 2.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 27%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.6%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
