Executable:   /scratch/ealnuaim/gromacs-simd-retry/AVX2_128/gromacs-install/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /scratch/ealnuaim/gromacs-simd-retry/AVX2_128/gromacs-install
Working dir:  /scratch/ealnuaim
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -s /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr -ntmpi 1 -ntomp 16 -nsteps 100

Compiled SIMD is AVX2_128, but AVX_512 might be faster (see log).
Reading file /users/ealnuaim/GROMACS_TestCaseB/lignocellulose.tpr, VERSION 2020.1 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 119, software tpx version 137
Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100 steps, 0.2 ps
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 1.262 to 1.407


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

GROMACS reminds you: "Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the same work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously." (David Goodstein)
